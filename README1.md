Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Titanic,(commonly known as the titanic)is British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 14–15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, en route to New York City from Southampton, England, killing about 1,500 passengers and ship personnel. It is arguably one of the most famous tragedies in modern history. It inspired numerous stories, several films, a musical and for us data scientists, a dataset. It has been the subject of much scholarship and scientific speculation.

# Question

Using K-Nearest Neighbors and Bayes Classifier, make predictions on whether or not a passanger survived the wreck on that fateful day

# Goal
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”

# Data
This dataset is a commonly used dataset and it was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview

# Environment and tools

1. Google colab Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn

# Bugs 

No known bugs
